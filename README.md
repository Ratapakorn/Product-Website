### JavaScript  
JavaScript is used to add interactivity and enhance the user experience. Features include:
- Responsive navigation menu
- Image sliders or carousels
- Form validation on the client side
- Dynamic DOM manipulation (e.g., product filters or toggles)

### PHP  
PHP is used for basic backend functionality such as:
- Handling form submissions (e.g., contact forms or product inquiries)
